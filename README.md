# PixiLearning
Learning Pixi.js by my own, while studying Design Patterns and Concurrent programming. Why? Because why not?

## So, You're studying Pixi.js, right? But why?

Yep. This is the purpose of this project. Mainly because I had the curiosity over this lib that's using WebGL and the HTML5 Canvas. Second because I need to learn design patterns.

Why not both and join the cheese and the knife?

## Is this your first time programming with HTML5?

Nope. This is one of many attempts to do something with HTML5. Although this might be my first "game" made with HTML5, I've tried to mess with Phaser before.

## Why Pixi.js?

Let's be honest: It's for a job opportunity. And because I love to study new things while doing nothing because I hate being unproductive and I don't wanna get bored while doing nothing. So, while I'm doing nothing, why I can't study and learn something new? 

_Quick observation:_ You're using VSCode for development, right? It's the same as me. So, you should consider running this line on your terminal: `npm install @types/pixi.js --save-dev`. 

**Why?** Because it's a complement and linter for Pixi.js and it will help you a lot. Easy as that. (as seen on https://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/30187-visual-studio-code-intellisense-code-completion/) :)
